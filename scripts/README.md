# Scripts Directory

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the Scripts Directory
The `scripts` directory is designed to provide a collection of starter scripts that streamline and expedite the initial phases of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Automation is a key component in CTF competitions, allowing participants to quickly gather information, identify potential targets, and proceed with more in-depth analysis. The scripts provided here are intended to simplify tasks such as network mapping and service enumeration, giving you a solid foundation to build upon as you progress through the challenges.

## 2. Organization of Scripts

### Subdirectories
The scripts are organized into subdirectories based on their primary function:

- **Networking**: This subdirectory contains scripts focused on network mapping and scanning. These scripts are designed to help you quickly assess the network environment, identify active hosts, and determine potential entry points.
  
- **Enumeration**: Here, you'll find scripts dedicated to enumerating services discovered during the network scans. These scripts delve deeper into specific services, extracting valuable information that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities.

### Naming Conventions
Scripts and subdirectories follow a consistent naming convention to ensure clarity and ease of use. Each script is named according to its primary function and the specific task it performs, making it easy to find the right tool for the job.

## 3. How to Use the Scripts

### General Usage
The scripts provided in this directory are intended to be run from the command line. Each script may have different requirements or dependencies, which will be noted in the script comments or documentation. Common dependencies include tools like Nmap or Python.

To run a script, navigate to the appropriate subdirectory and execute the script using your terminal or command prompt. For example:

```bash
cd Networking
./basic_nmap_scan.sh
```

### Customizing Scripts
While these scripts are designed to be effective out of the box, you may need to customize them to suit specific needs. This could involve modifying command-line parameters, changing scan options, or adjusting output formats.

For example, you can modify the target IP range or add additional flags to an Nmap script to perform more comprehensive scans.

## 4. Starter Scripts Overview

### Networking Scripts

The Networking subdirectory includes scripts that perform various types of network scans, from basic host discovery to more advanced scanning techniques utilizing the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). These scripts are intended to provide a quick overview of the network environment, helping you identify active hosts and potential vulnerabilities.
- `Basic Nmap Scan`: A script for quickly scanning a network to identify live hosts and open ports.
- `Advanced Nmap Scan with NSE`: A more in-depth script that uses Nmap’s Scripting Engine to gather detailed information about services running on open ports.

### Enumeration Scripts

The Enumeration subdirectory contains scripts that further investigate the services identified during the network scans. These scripts focus on extracting detailed information from specific services, such as web servers, SMB shares, or other network services.
- `Web Server Enumeration`: A script for enumerating web servers, identifying directories, and extracting information about the web application.
- `SMB Share Enumeration`: A script designed to list shared folders and extract information from SMB services.

## 5. Contributing to the Scripts Directory

### How to Contribute

We encourage you to contribute your own scripts to this directory! If you have developed a script that you believe would be valuable to others, feel free to submit it. When contributing, please ensure that your script is well-documented, follows the naming conventions, and is placed in the appropriate subdirectory.

### Future Expansion

The collection of scripts in this directory will continue to grow over time. As new challenges emerge and tools evolve, we plan to expand this repository with additional subdirectories and more advanced scripts. Your contributions are a key part of this growth.

## 6. Disclaimer

### Usage Responsibility

The scripts provided in this directory are powerful tools designed for use in legal and authorized environments only. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have permission to run these scripts on any network or system. Unauthorized use of these scripts could result in legal consequences.

## 7. Conclusion

### Final Thoughts

Automation is a powerful ally in CTF competitions, allowing you to work more efficiently and focus on the critical aspects of each challenge. The scripts provided here are just a starting point—feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon them as you see fit. The more you engage with these tools, the better prepared you will be to tackle the challenges ahead.

_Happy hacking!_
