# Web Exploitation

## 1. Introduction

### What is Web Exploitation?
Web Exploitation is a common category in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions that involves discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. These challenges test your ability to understand web technologies and identify security flaws that can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or perform other malicious actions. Mastery of web exploitation techniques is crucial for anyone looking to excel in CTFs, as many real-world cyber threats originate from web vulnerabilities.

## 2. Common Web Exploitation Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is improperly sanitized and directly used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query and execute arbitrary SQL commands.

- **Exploitation Techniques**:
  - **Union-Based SQLi**: Appending a `UNION` query to combine results from multiple SELECT statements.
  - **Error-Based SQLi**: Triggering database errors to retrieve information about the structure of the database.
  - **Blind SQLi**: Exploiting SQLi without receiving direct feedback from the database, often using boolean-based or time-based techniques.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when an application allows users to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others. XSS can be used to steal cookies, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

- **Types of XSS**:
  - **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message or search result.
  - **Stored XSS**: The script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a forum post or comment field.
  - **DOM-Based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side script, where the DOM is modified based on user input.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick a user into performing actions they didn’t intend to on a different website where the user is authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as changing account details or making purchases.

- **Exploitation Techniques**:
  - **Form Submission**: Crafting a hidden form that automatically submits with the user’s session credentials.
  - **Image or Link Exploits**: Embedding malicious URLs or scripts in images or links that users might click on unknowingly.

### Directory Traversal
Directory Traversal vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended scope.

- **Exploitation Techniques**:
  - **../ Exploitation**: Using `../` sequences to traverse to parent directories.
  - **Encoding Techniques**: Bypassing filters by encoding characters (e.g., URL encoding) to access restricted files.

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can trick the server into making requests to internal or unintended resources. This can be used to access internal services, retrieve sensitive information, or even exploit other vulnerabilities within the internal network.

- **Exploitation Techniques**:
  - **Local Resource Access**: Exploiting SSRF to access local resources such as metadata services in cloud environments.
  - **Remote Exploitation**: Using SSRF to interact with remote services, often leveraging the server’s privileges to bypass firewalls or other network controls.

### Other Common Vulnerabilities
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: Allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. LFI can lead to arbitrary code execution under certain conditions.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**: Similar to LFI, but allows an attacker to include files from a remote server, potentially leading to code execution.
- **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)**: Involves injecting multiple parameters with the same name into a single HTTP request to bypass input validation or exploit logic flaws.

## 3. Tools for Web Exploitation

### Burp Suite
Burp Suite is one of the most powerful tools for web exploitation. It provides a comprehensive set of features for testing web applications, including intercepting HTTP requests, scanning for vulnerabilities, and automating attacks.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Intruder**: Automates customized attacks such as brute force or fuzzing.
  - **Repeater**: Allows manual testing by modifying and re-sending HTTP requests.
  - **Scanner**: Automates the detection of common web vulnerabilities.
  - **Proxy**: Intercepts and modifies traffic between your browser and the target application.

### OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source alternative to Burp Suite, offering similar functionality for web application security testing.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Active and Passive Scanning**: Automatically scan for vulnerabilities while browsing.
  - **Spidering**: Crawls the application to discover all pages and inputs.
  - **Manual Testing**: Similar to Burp’s Repeater, allows for manual manipulation of requests.

### SQLmap
SQLmap is a powerful tool specifically designed for automating SQL injection attacks. It can detect and exploit various types of SQL injection vulnerabilities and even provide options for extracting data or executing commands.

- **Common Usage**:
  - **Detection**: Automatically tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Exploitation**: Extracts database information, including table contents and user credentials.
  - **Command Execution**: Allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.

### Other Useful Tools
- **Nikto**: A web server scanner that identifies potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- **Wfuzz**: A tool for brute forcing web applications, useful for finding hidden resources and testing for parameter injection.
- **Custom Scripts**: Writing your own scripts in Python, Bash, or other languages can be highly effective for specialized tasks or when standard tools fall short.

## 4. Strategies and Best Practices

### Understanding the Target
Before diving into an attack, it’s crucial to understand the web application’s architecture, underlying technologies, and potential entry points for exploitation.

- **Identify Technologies**: Determine what technologies the web application uses (e.g., PHP, ASP.NET, JavaScript frameworks) as this can give clues about potential vulnerabilities.
- **Analyze Structure**: Map out the site’s structure, including all available pages and user inputs, to ensure thorough testing.

### Methodical Testing
A systematic approach to testing ensures that you don’t overlook potential vulnerabilities.

- **Automated vs. Manual Testing**: Use automated tools to quickly identify obvious vulnerabilities, but complement this with manual testing to uncover more complex issues.
- **Fuzzing**: Use fuzzing techniques to send unexpected or malformed data to inputs and observe how the application handles it.

### Prioritizing Exploits
Focus on vulnerabilities that offer the highest impact and are easiest to exploit.

- **Impact vs. Effort**: Prioritize vulnerabilities that can lead to significant data exposure or system compromise with minimal effort.
- **Move Quickly**: If a vulnerability doesn’t seem promising after initial exploration, move on to another target rather than getting stuck.

### Exfiltrating Data
Once a vulnerability is exploited, the next step is often to exfiltrate data.

- **Data Extraction**: Extract sensitive information such as credentials, financial data, or proprietary information.
- **Avoiding Detection**: Minimize the risk of detection by the target’s security systems by using stealthy techniques and exfiltrating data slowly or in chunks.

## 5. Real-World Examples

### Case Study: SQL Injection
In a recent CTF, a SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in a login form. By manipulating the form input, the attacker was able to bypass authentication and access the admin panel. From there, additional SQL injection points were identified, allowing the attacker to dump the entire user database, including hashed passwords.

### Case Study: XSS
In another CTF, a stored XSS vulnerability was found in the comment section of a blog. The attacker injected a malicious script that executed whenever an admin viewed the comment, leading to the theft of the admin’s session cookie. This allowed the attacker to take over the admin’s account and modify site content.

### Other Examples
- **SSRF in Cloud Environments**: An SSRF vulnerability in a cloud-based web application allowed attackers to access internal metadata services, leading to the compromise of API keys and other sensitive information.
