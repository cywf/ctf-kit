## 2. Introduction

### Purpose of This Document
This document provides a brief overview of the different types of challenges you might encounter in a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition. Understanding the various challenge categories will help you better prepare and strategize for your next CTF event.

CTF challenges are typically categorized based on the skills and knowledge they test. Below, you'll find summaries of the most common challenge types, which will give you an idea of what to expect and where to focus your practice.

## 3. Challenge Type Summaries

### Web Exploitation
Web exploitation challenges involve discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. These challenges often require knowledge of web technologies, security principles, and common vulnerabilities.

**Common tasks include**:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Directory Traversal
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### Cryptography
Cryptography challenges test your ability to understand and break encryption schemes. These challenges require knowledge of various cryptographic algorithms and techniques, as well as the ability to think critically about how data is secured and how it might be compromised.

**Common tasks include**:
- Breaking ciphers
- Decrypting messages
- Understanding and exploiting cryptographic flaws
- Implementing or reversing cryptographic algorithms

### Forensics
Forensics challenges involve analyzing data, such as files or network traffic, to uncover hidden information or reconstruct events. These challenges require attention to detail and proficiency with forensic tools and techniques.

**Common tasks include**:
- Analyzing file metadata
- Recovering deleted data
- Investigating log files
- Examining network traffic captures

### Reverse Engineering
Reverse engineering challenges require you to analyze and understand the inner workings of compiled software. These challenges often involve disassembling or decompiling binaries to uncover hidden functionality or bypass protections.

**Common tasks include**:
- Disassembling binaries
- Decompiling code
- Identifying and patching vulnerabilities
- Understanding obfuscation techniques

### Miscellaneous
The miscellaneous category encompasses challenges that don't fit neatly into the other categories. These can include anything from steganography and puzzles to social engineering scenarios.

**Types of challenges might include**:
- Steganography (hiding data within images or other media)
- Puzzles and riddles
- Social engineering tasks
- Custom or unusual challenges

## 4. Conclusion
