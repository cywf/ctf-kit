# Jeopardy-Style CTF

## 1. Introduction

### What is a Jeopardy-Style CTF?
A Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag (CTF) is a popular format in cybersecurity competitions where participants solve a series of challenges in various categories to earn points. The format is named after the game show "Jeopardy!" where participants select from a board of categories, each containing questions or tasks of varying difficulty levels and point values. Unlike other CTF formats like Attack-Defense or King of the Hill, Jeopardy-style CTFs are more focused on individual challenge-solving rather than real-time attacks and defenses.

## 2. How Jeopardy-Style CTFs Work

### Challenge Structure
In a Jeopardy-style CTF, challenges are organized into distinct categories such as Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, and Miscellaneous. Each challenge has a point value assigned to it, typically reflecting its difficulty level. Easier challenges yield fewer points, while harder challenges offer more significant rewards.

Participants or teams choose which challenges to tackle based on their strengths and the point values offered. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible by solving challenges and submitting the correct flags.

### Scoreboard
The scoreboard is a crucial component of any Jeopardy-style CTF. It tracks the progress of all participants or teams in real-time, displaying their current score and rank. The scoreboard helps competitors gauge their standing relative to others and can influence their strategy as the competition progresses.

- **Accuracy**: It’s important to submit flags accurately. Incorrect submissions may not only cost time but can also lead to penalties in some competitions.
- **Ranking**: Scores are totaled based on the points earned from each challenge. The participant or team with the highest score at the end of the event typically wins.

## 3. Communication and Collaboration

### Preferred Communication Tools
Communication is key during a CTF event, especially when participating as a team. Most CTFs utilize platforms like Discord for real-time communication between participants, organizers, and support staff. Discord channels are often set up for general discussions, specific challenge categories, and announcements.

### Working Solo vs. Team Participation
- **Solo Participation**: Competing solo allows for full control over which challenges to tackle and how to manage time. However, it can be more challenging as there is no one to bounce ideas off or share the workload.
- **Team Participation**: Working as a team can significantly enhance your chances of success. Teams can divide and conquer by assigning challenges based on each member’s strengths. Collaboration can lead to faster problem-solving and more comprehensive strategies.

### Team Composition
For those choosing to participate as a team, consider the following tips for team composition:
- **Diverse Skill Sets**: Ensure your team has members with different expertise, such as web security, cryptography, and reverse engineering. This diversity allows the team to tackle a broader range of challenges.
- **Communication**: Establish clear communication channels and strategies before the event. Regular check-ins during the CTF help in adjusting strategies and sharing progress.

## 4. Strategy and Preparation

### Pre-CTF Preparation
Preparation is key to performing well in a Jeopardy-style CTF. Here’s how to get started:
- **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have all necessary tools installed and configured on your machine. This may include setting up virtual machines (VMs), Docker containers, and specialized tools for web exploitation, cryptography, and more.
- **Practice**: Familiarize yourself with common challenge types by practicing on platforms like Hack The Box, OverTheWire, and CTFtime. Reviewing past CTF challenges can also provide insight into the types of problems you may encounter.

### During the CTF
- **Challenge Prioritization**: Start by tackling challenges in categories where you’re strongest, or begin with easier challenges to quickly accumulate points.
- **Time Management**: Allocate time based on the difficulty and point value of challenges. Avoid getting stuck on one challenge for too long; if you’re not making progress, move on and return later.
- **Document Your Process**: Keep notes on how you approach each challenge. This documentation can be useful for writing up solutions later and helps in reviewing what worked or didn’t work.

## 5. Completion vs. Speed

### Focus on Completion
While speed is a factor in CTFs, especially in determining rankings, the primary focus should be on completing as many challenges as possible. Completing challenges not only boosts your score but also enhances your understanding of the underlying concepts.

- **Thoroughness**: Take the time to understand each challenge and the solution process. This thoroughness will help in future competitions and real-world scenarios.
- **Learning from Mistakes**: If you make mistakes, take note of them. The lessons learned from thoroughly working through challenges will contribute to faster and more accurate problem-solving in the future.

### Natural Progression of Speed
As you become more experienced, your speed in solving challenges will naturally improve. This progression comes from building a strong foundation in key areas and refining your problem-solving strategies over time.

- **Balance**: Strive to balance accuracy with speed. Quick submissions are important, but incorrect submissions can cost valuable time and points.

## 6. Scoring and Tracking

### How Scoring Works
In a Jeopardy-style CTF, points are awarded based on the difficulty of the challenges. Typically, easier challenges offer fewer points, while more difficult ones offer more. Understanding how points are distributed can help you plan your strategy.

- **Challenge Points**: Each challenge has a set point value that contributes to your overall score once you successfully submit the flag.
- **Total Score**: Your total score is the sum of all points earned from successfully completed challenges.

### Scoreboard Visualization
CTF organizers often provide a scoreboard interface where you can see your current ranking, total points, and comparison with other participants or teams. Understanding how to read and interpret the scoreboard can help you adjust your strategy during the competition.

- **Example**: Many CTFs use platforms like CTFd, which offers a clean and easy-to-understand scoreboard showing ranks, points, and time of submission.

## 7. Post-CTF Review

### Reviewing Your Performance
After the CTF, take time to review your performance. Analyze which challenges you completed successfully and which ones you struggled with. This review process is critical for continuous improvement.

- **Completed Challenges**: Review your successful solutions to reinforce what you’ve learned and identify best practices.
- **Missed Challenges**: For challenges you didn’t complete, consider revisiting them after the CTF to understand the solution. This follow-up practice is invaluable for skill development.

### Sharing Writeups
Contributing writeups is a great way to give back to the community and solidify your understanding of the challenges.

- **Structure**: A good writeup should include a clear explanation of the problem, the steps you took to solve it, and any scripts or tools you used.
- **Contribution**: Share your writeups with the community, either through this repository or on platforms like CTFtime. This helps others learn and also helps you establish your reputation within the community.

## 8. Conclusion

### Final Thoughts
