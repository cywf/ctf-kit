# King of the Hill (KotH) CTF

## 1. Introduction

### What is a King of the Hill (KotH) CTF?
A King of the Hill (KotH) Capture The Flag (CTF) is a competitive format where participants vie for control over a specific target, such as a server or service. The objective is to gain control of the target and maintain that control for as long as possible, while simultaneously defending against attempts by other participants to take control. Unlike Jeopardy-style CTFs, which focus on solving isolated challenges, and Attack-Defense CTFs, which involve simultaneous offense and defense across multiple targets, KotH CTFs are all about holding the upper hand in a dynamic, real-time environment.

## 2. How King of the Hill CTFs Work

### Challenge Structure
In a KotH CTF, participants compete to gain and retain control over a central target. This target could be a server, a service, or another digital asset that all participants are trying to exploit and secure. The gameplay is dynamic, with control constantly shifting as participants launch attacks, gain access, and fortify their positions.

- **Core Objective**: The primary goal is to be the "king" by maintaining control of the target for the longest period. Control is typically measured by uptime or the duration for which the target remains under your control.
- **Competitive Nature**: Unlike other CTF formats, KotH is intensely competitive, with all participants or teams focusing on a single target, leading to constant conflict and turnover in control.

### Scoring System
The scoring in a KotH CTF is based on how long a participant or team can maintain control over the target:

- **Points for Control**: Points are awarded for the duration of time that the target remains under your control. The longer you maintain control, the more points you accumulate.
- **Uptime and Defensive Measures**: Points can also be influenced by how effectively you defend the target once you control it. Effective defenses that prevent others from gaining control will help maintain your uptime and score.
- **Penalties**: Points may be deducted or you may lose control if the target is compromised by another participant. This competitive aspect drives the need for both aggressive attacks and robust defenses.

## 3. Team Dynamics and Strategy

### Team Roles and Responsibilities
Success in a KotH CTF often depends on how well you can coordinate your team and assign roles. While it’s possible to compete solo, a team-based approach can provide significant advantages.

- **Attackers**: Focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the target and executing attacks to gain initial control.
- **Defenders**: Once control is gained, defenders work to secure the target by patching vulnerabilities, setting up monitoring, and blocking further attacks.
- **Strategists**: Oversee the overall plan, deciding when to attack and when to bolster defenses, ensuring the team can adapt to changing conditions.

### Communication and Collaboration
Effective communication is vital in a KotH CTF, especially during the rapid changes in control:

- **Real-Time Coordination**: Teams often use platforms like Discord for real-time communication. This allows for quick decision-making, such as when to launch a coordinated attack or shift focus to defense.
- **Information Sharing**: Attackers and defenders must share information constantly. Attackers need to inform defenders about the vulnerabilities they exploited, so those can be patched and fortified once control is established.

### Solo vs. Team Participation
Whether participating solo or as a team, different strategies apply:

- **Solo Participation**: Competing solo requires you to balance both attack and defense on your own, which can be challenging. However, it offers full control over your strategy and actions.
- **Team Participation**: In a team, roles can be divided, allowing for specialized focus on either attack or defense. This division can lead to more efficient control and a higher likelihood of maintaining the target for extended periods.

## 4. Preparation and Real-Time Strategy

### Pre-CTF Preparation
Preparation is key to excelling in a KotH CTF. Here’s how to get ready:

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure that your tools and systems are set up and ready to go. This includes having your offensive tools configured and defensive strategies planned out.
- **Vulnerability Knowledge**: Familiarize yourself with common vulnerabilities that are likely to be present in the target. Understanding these can give you an edge in both gaining and maintaining control.
- **Practice**: Use platforms like Hack The Box or other custom environments to practice gaining control and then defending against counter-attacks.

### During the CTF
The real-time nature of KotH CTFs requires constant attention and adaptability:

- **Gaining Initial Control**: Start by identifying the fastest and most reliable way to gain control of the target. This may involve exploiting well-known vulnerabilities or finding a weak spot in the target’s defenses.
- **Maintaining Control**: Once you’ve gained control, your focus should shift to fortifying your position. Patch vulnerabilities, set up defensive measures, and monitor for incoming attacks.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on the actions of opponents. If you’re losing control, quickly identify the cause and counteract it, whether through reattacking or reinforcing defenses.

## 5. Scoring and Tracking

### Understanding the Scoring System
Points in a KotH CTF are primarily based on control duration:

- **Control Duration**: Points are awarded for the length of time that the target remains under your control. Maintaining continuous control is the key to a high score.
- **Defensive Effectiveness**: In addition to control time, the effectiveness of your defensive measures can influence your score. Keeping the target secure and preventing others from taking control contributes to maintaining uptime and accumulating points.
- **Penalties**: Losing control of the target can result in point deductions or a reset of your control duration, which can significantly impact your overall score.

### Scoreboard and Monitoring
The scoreboard in a KotH CTF provides real-time feedback on your performance:

- **Typical Setup**: A KotH scoreboard will show the current "king," the control duration, and other participants' attempts to gain control.
- **Using the Scoreboard**: Regularly monitor the scoreboard to track your standing and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you’re close to losing control, it might be time to shift resources to defense or plan a reattack.

## 6. Tools and Resources

### Essential Tools
Having the right tools ready is crucial for both gaining and maintaining control:

- **For Attacking**: Tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and custom exploit scripts can help you find and exploit vulnerabilities to gain control.
- **For Defending**: Tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and monitoring software are essential for keeping the target secure once you’ve taken control.

### Resource Management
Effective management of limited resources, such as time and personnel, is crucial:

- **Prioritization**: Focus on the most critical tasks first—whether it’s executing a known exploit to gain control or immediately patching vulnerabilities once you’re in control.
- **Adaptability**: Be prepared to shift resources between offensive and defensive roles as the situation demands. Flexibility can be the difference between maintaining control and losing it.

### Learning Platforms
To prepare for a King of the Hill CTF, consider practicing on these platforms:

- **Hack The Box**: Offers a wide range of challenges that simulate real-world King of the Hill scenarios, where gaining and maintaining control is key.
- **Custom CTF Environments**: Set up your own KotH practice environments to hone your skills in both attack and defense.

## 7. Post-CTF Review

### Reviewing Your Performance
After the competition, it’s important to review your performance to learn and improve:

- **Analyze Control Logs**: Review the logs to understand how you gained and maintained control, and where you might have lost it. This analysis can reveal both strengths and weaknesses in your strategy.
- **Defense Reports**: Assess how well your defensive measures performed. Identify any vulnerabilities that were exploited by others and consider how they could be better mitigated in future competitions.

### Sharing Writeups and Insights
Documenting and sharing your experiences benefits both your team and the broader CTF community:

- **Writeups**: A good writeup should cover your approach, the tools and techniques used, and lessons learned. These insights can help others improve their strategies and also serve as a reference for future competitions.
- **Contribution**: Share your writeups in this repository or on CTF platforms like CTFtime. Contributing to the community not only helps others but also enhances your team’s reputation.
