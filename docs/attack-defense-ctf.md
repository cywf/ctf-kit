# Attack-Defense CTF

## 1. Introduction

### What is an Attack-Defense CTF?
An Attack-Defense Capture The Flag (CTF) is a dynamic and challenging format where participants are divided into teams. Each team is responsible for both defending their own infrastructure and attacking the infrastructure of other teams. Unlike Jeopardy-style CTFs, where the focus is on solving isolated challenges, Attack-Defense CTFs require participants to engage in real-time strategic thinking, both offensively and defensively. Success in this format relies heavily on teamwork, effective communication, and a deep understanding of both attack and defense techniques.

## 2. How Attack-Defense CTFs Work

### Challenge Structure
In an Attack-Defense CTF, each team is given a set of vulnerable systems to defend while simultaneously attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the systems of other teams. The competition typically unfolds in a controlled environment where each team’s actions are logged and monitored.

- **Dual Objectives**: Teams must balance their efforts between protecting their own infrastructure from attacks and identifying and exploiting weaknesses in the opponents' systems.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The real-time nature of Attack-Defense CTFs requires constant vigilance and quick adaptation to changing circumstances.

### Scoring System
Scoring in an Attack-Defense CTF is multifaceted, reflecting both offensive and defensive successes:

- **Points for Attacks**: Teams earn points by successfully exploiting vulnerabilities in the systems of other teams. This may include gaining unauthorized access, defacing services, or extracting sensitive data.
- **Points for Defense**: Teams also score points for effectively defending their own systems. This includes maintaining service uptime, patching vulnerabilities, and successfully thwarting incoming attacks.
- **Penalties**: Points may be deducted for allowing critical vulnerabilities to be exploited or for failing to maintain system availability.

## 3. Team Dynamics and Composition

### Team Roles and Responsibilities
Success in an Attack-Defense CTF hinges on the efficient division of roles within a team. Common roles include:

- **Attackers**: Focused on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the opponents' systems.
- **Defenders**: Responsible for securing and hardening the team’s own infrastructure against incoming attacks.
- **Strategists**: Oversee the overall strategy, making real-time decisions about resource allocation and adjusting tactics as needed.

### Communication and Collaboration
Effective communication is crucial in Attack-Defense CTFs:

- **Real-Time Coordination**: Teams typically use platforms like Discord for instant communication. This allows for quick decision-making and the ability to adapt strategies on the fly.
- **Sharing Information**: Continuous sharing of information between attackers and defenders is essential. Attackers can inform defenders about the techniques they’ve used, which can help in anticipating similar moves from opponents.

### Team Composition
Assembling a well-rounded team is critical for success in an Attack-Defense CTF:

- **Diverse Skill Sets**: Teams should include members with expertise in both offensive security (e.g., penetration testing) and defensive measures (e.g., network security, intrusion detection).
- **Flexibility**: Roles may shift during the CTF, with team members needing to adapt to changing circumstances and emerging threats.

## 4. Preparation and Strategy

### Pre-CTF Preparation
Preparation is key to excelling in an Attack-Defense CTF. Here’s how to get ready:

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure that your infrastructure is correctly configured. This includes setting up virtual machines (VMs), firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other defensive tools.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Conduct a thorough assessment of your systems to identify and patch vulnerabilities before the competition begins.
- **Practice**: Use simulation platforms or previous CTF environments to practice both attacking and defending. Understanding common attack vectors and defense mechanisms will give your team a significant advantage.

### During the CTF
During the competition, maintaining a balance between attacking and defending is crucial:

- **Attack Strategy**: Identify and prioritize the most vulnerable targets in opponents’ systems. Coordinate attacks to maximize impact and score.
- **Defense Strategy**: Monitor your systems continuously, respond quickly to alerts, and apply patches or mitigations as needed.
- **Resource Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your team’s resources—who focuses on attacking, who defends, and when to shift focus.

### Real-Time Monitoring
Keeping a close eye on both your systems and the scoreboard is essential:

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring tools to track system performance, detect intrusions, and maintain service availability.
- **Scoreboard**: Regularly check the scoreboard to see how your team is performing relative to others. Use this information to adjust your strategy.

## 5. Scoring and Tracking

### Understanding the Scoring System
Points in an Attack-Defense CTF are awarded based on both offensive and defensive actions:

- **Offensive Points**: Earned by compromising opponents' systems, defacing services, or extracting sensitive data.
- **Defensive Points**: Awarded for keeping your systems secure, maintaining uptime, and successfully preventing or mitigating attacks.

### Scoreboard and Monitoring
The scoreboard provides real-time feedback on your team’s performance:

- **Typical Setup**: Most Attack-Defense CTFs feature a scoreboard that displays each team’s points, their rank, and sometimes more detailed metrics on attacks and defenses.
- **Using the Scoreboard**: Regularly monitor the scoreboard to track your progress and adjust your strategy accordingly. A sudden drop in points may indicate a successful attack on your systems, prompting an immediate defensive response.

## 6. Tools and Resources

### Essential Tools
A well-prepared team will have a suite of tools ready for both attacking and defending:

- **For Attacking**: Tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and custom exploit scripts can be invaluable for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **For Defending**: Tools like Snort (IDS/IPS), firewalls, and logging/monitoring software are crucial for detecting and preventing attacks.

### Resource Management
Effective management of limited resources, such as time and personnel, is crucial:

- **Prioritization**: Focus on the most critical tasks first—whether it’s patching a known vulnerability in your system or launching an attack on an opponent.
- **Adaptability**: Be prepared to shift resources between offensive and defensive roles as the situation demands.

### Learning Platforms
To prepare for an Attack-Defense CTF, consider practicing on these platforms:

- **Hack The Box**: Offers a wide range of challenges that simulate real-world attack-defense scenarios.
- **CTFd Challenges**: Some CTFd-hosted competitions include Attack-Defense scenarios where you can hone your skills.

## 7. Post-CTF Review

### Reviewing Your Performance
After the competition, a thorough review of your team’s performance is essential:

- **Analyze Attack Logs**: Review the logs to understand which attacks were successful and which defenses held up. This analysis can reveal both strengths and weaknesses in your strategy.
- **Defense Reports**: Assess how well your defensive measures performed. Identify any vulnerabilities that were exploited and consider how they could be better mitigated in the future.

### Sharing Writeups and Insights
Documenting and sharing your experiences benefits both your team and the broader CTF community:

- **Writeups**: A good writeup should cover your approach, the tools and techniques used, and lessons learned. These insights can help others improve their strategies and also serve as a reference for future competitions.
- **Contribution**: Share your writeups in this repository or on CTF platforms like CTFtime. Contributing to the community not only helps others but also enhances your team’s reputation.
